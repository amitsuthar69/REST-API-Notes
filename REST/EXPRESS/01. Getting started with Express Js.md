## What's Express Js 
1. Express.js is a popular and powerful web application framework for Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime environment.

2. Express.js acts as a middleman between the client (user's browser) and the server, simplifying the process of handling these requests and responses.

3. Express.js is based on the concept of routes. A route is like a mapping between a URL (path) and a specific function or handler.

4. When a user makes a request to a specific URL, Express.js looks for the corresponding route and executes the associated function, generating the response that the client receives.

### Node Js vs Express Js
- Why tf we need an another framework if it can be done using Node js itself ?

1. Node.js itself provides a basic HTTP module for building servers, but it's relatively low-level. Express.js abstracts away some of the complexity of raw HTTP handling, making it faster and easier to create web applications.

2. Express.js provides a clean and organized way to handle routes and map them to specific functions. This makes it easier to manage different URL paths and keeps your code structured and maintainable.

3. While it's possible to build web applications using only Node.js, using Express.js as a framework offers a higher level of abstraction, better organization, and additional features that streamline the development process.

## Getting Started with Express JS

- Install the Express.js package in your Node.js project :

``` npm install express```

- Create an Entry Point File Create a new file in your project folder and name it **app.js** or **index.js**. This will be the entry point of your Express.js application.

- Set Up Your Express Application In the app.js or index.js file, import Express and create your application :

```js
// import express module
const express = require("express");

// creating an instance of express function
const app = express();

// Setting up a port 
const port = 3000;

// creating routes : app.method(path, handler)
app.get('/', function(req, res){
   res.send("Hello world!");
)};

/* let's start the server and listen on the specified
app.listen(port, [host], [backlog], [callback]])*/
port:app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Save the file, go to your terminal and type the following.

```node index.js```

This will start the server. To test this app, 
open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 
and a message will be displayed as in the following screenshot,

### Let's breakdown this code :
1. **.get('/')** : This is a route definition. It sets up a route for the HTTP **GET** method and specifies the URL path as '/', which means the **root path** of the website. In simple terms, when someone visits the *homepage of your website*, this route will handle the request

2. **(req, res) => { ... }** : This is an arrow function (a type of JavaScript function). It is the handler function for the route. When a request matches the specified route (in this case, a GET request to the root path '/'), Express.js will execute this function

3. **req** : This is an abbreviation for "request," and it represents the HTTP **request object**. It contains information about the incoming request, such as *"headers, URL parameters, query parameters, and more**

4. **res** : This is an abbreviation for "response," and it represents the HTTP **response** object. It allows you to send back a response to the client who made the request.

#### Response object methods (res.)
| Method | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| res.send | sends a response back to client |
| res.json | sends a response in JSON format |
| res.render | renders an HTML view / file |
| res.redirect | redirects the client to different URL |
| res.sendFile | sends a files as response to client |
| res.status | sets the HTTP status code for response |
| res.cookie | sets a cookie in client's browser |
| res.clearCookie | clears the previously set cookie |
| res.setHeader | sets an individual HTTP header for the response |
| res.set | allows setting multiple HTTP headers in a single call |
| res.get | retrieves the value of an HTTP header from the request |
| res.locals | pass data to view trmplate engine |
| res.end | ends the response process |
| res.download | initiate a fioe download |
| res.type | sets the Content-Type header for the response |
| res.format | Performs content negotiation based on the client's Accept header |
