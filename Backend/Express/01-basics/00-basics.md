## Basic concepts

Here are few basic concepts you need to know inorder to learn Express, REST API or any other backend technology.

1. HTTP Fundamental :

- HTTP methods: HTTP methods are used to specify the action that the client is requesting.

  The most common HTTP methods are **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH**.

---

- HTTP headers: HTTP headers are used to provide additional information about the request or response.

  Some common HTTP headers include **Content-Type (text/plain, application/json), Content-Length, and Accept**.

---

- HTTP status codes: HTTP status codes are used to indicate the outcome of the request.

  Some common HTTP status codes include **200 OK, 404 Not Found, and 500 Internal Server Error**.

---

- HTTP cookies: HTTP cookies are used to store information about the client on the client's computer.

  Cookies can be used to track the user's browsing history, keep the user logged in to a website, or personalize the user's experience.

---

- HTTP caching: HTTP caching is used to store copies of frequently accessed resources in memory.

  This can improve the performance of the web by reducing the number of times that resources need to be fetched from the server.

---

- HTTP security: HTTP security is concerned with protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of HTTP data.

  Some common HTTP security measures include encryption, authentication, and authorization.
