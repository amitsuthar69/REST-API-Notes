## MongoDB

MongoDB is a non-relational document based database which holds data inside a 'document'. This document is a JSON object and many other documents are grouped together to form a 'collection'. 

A Model defines a collection for the database and a Schema defines the document. Schema is the internal representation for the document.

For example, Users is Model and for each user, its name, age, gender would be its Schema. This user model can hold any number of documents.
